Hi, 

My name is Patrick Loots and I am a third here at the BIT. My favourite hobbies are drawing and gaming which I seem to do alot of in my free time. 
My favourite aspect of BIT is learning about the coding of robots and gadgets such as arduino and rasberry pi. I took vocational skills to 
learn more about time and self management and to learn key aspects about getting a job in the IT world that I think have been neglected in my other classes. 
I intend to take as much as I can from the class and apply them to my pursuits of a great IT career I strive to have one day.
